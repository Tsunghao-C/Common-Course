# Client-Side Rendering (CSR) vs Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

### References
1. [CSR vs SSR](https://prismic.io/blog/client-side-vs-server-side-rendering)


The key difference is:

Without SSR: Browser must download HTML → parse JavaScript → build UI → start game
With SSR: Browser receives complete HTML → show UI immediately → JavaScript enhances for gameplay

So while the actual gameplay still runs client-side, SSR provides a better initial experience and faster perceived loading time. Would you like me to show how you could implement this in your current project?
